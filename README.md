**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Written using Haxe, with haxeflixel and its library flixel-ui.

2D tile-based editors are really neat. I personally use Ogmo Editor, and it covers all my mapping needs. However, I often find that I need to set different properties for tiles. I used to hard-code that, or write JSON files by hand. In the end, I got sick of these horrible solutions so I wrote a sort of Ogmo Editor for tilesets, where it's possible to attribute properties to every tile in a tileset.

TODO:
*Figure out flash local file sandbox security stuff
*Rework architecture
*Explain tilesheet JSON format
*Write flixel loader for tilesheets
